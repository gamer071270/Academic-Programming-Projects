# Academic-Programming-Projects

- This repository consists of 3 different projects written in Java.
- These projects are created for academic courses.
- The primary motivation behind creating these projects is to advance in object-oriented programming and write algorithms that are effective in terms of time and space by using specific data structures.
- No Java classes were imported except java.util.ArrayList and java.util.LinkedList. So certain data structures such as AVLT tree, Heap, HashTables are implemented from scratch.

# GigMatch Pro

- This project is able to register customers and freelancers to an application called GigMatch Pro, process service requests and employments, support cancellations with consequences, provide user queries, and support a month simulation mechanism that updates burnout, skill evolution, and loyalty tiers.
- Most importanly, it matches customers with freelancers according to certain constraints in the least amount of time.

# MatrixNet - The Operator's Console

- MatrixNet is able to create hosts with unique IDs and clearance levels.
- Hosts are able to connect to other hosts through backdoor tunnels with specified latency, bandwidth, and firewall parameters.
- The system should find optimal routes between hosts while respecting bandwidth, security, and latency constraints.
- Analyzes infrastructure connectivity and detect critical failure points.
- Generates comprehensive topology reports showing system statistics.

# Nightpass - A Survival Card Game

- Nightpass is a card-based survival game focused on rule-driven gameplay and strategic deck management.
- The game processes commands from an input file to simulate card duels against an AI opponent, selecting optimal card matches based on defined priority rules.
- Cards are defined by attack and health values, and the system handles combat resolution, damage, elimination, and card restoration mechanics.
